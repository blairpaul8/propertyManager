  to excel in Adobe. 

  !!!Important once you have the excel file the cells need to be formatted to text. This is

    3. Select Format

  If this isn't done excel will drop leading zeros on serial numbers that begin with 0.

    - names and team number

  2. Upload the provided blank 2062 and 1750. (NOTE: Must be done every time website is opened)
      - !!!Must use provided 2062/1750 files not all PDFs are the same!!!!

  3. Upload at least one property book file (Note. must be in excel format.)

  4. Press "continue" 


## Main Page 

    From the main page you can make all the assignments to build out gun boxes or general
box. Additionally, items can be searched for at the top by LIN and MPO description or by 
serial number.

  Important note: On the left side bar there is a "Save Settings" button this should be used 
frequently so that equipment assignments are not lost. Also, this enables you to upload all
the settings if the website is closed by using the "Upload Settings" button.


## Gun Boxes Page

  From this page you can view all the gun boxes by name. Each one can be opened to view the 
items assigned to each person. Also, from here at the top you can choose between generating 
2062s/1750s or deleting a box resetting the assignments for that person.

Generate 2062:
  You will be prompted to select which boxes you want to generate 2062s for. This will create
an individual 2062 for each box and one master 2062 with all items being signed out. 

Generate 1750:
  This has similar functionality as 2062 but wont make a master 1750 because it is not needed.


## General Boxes Page

  This page is for boxes apart from gun boxes for example Commo Box or Med Box. These boxes can be created
on the main page and items can be assigned to them. In the General Boxes page there is the same option to
view what is inside the boxes and 2062s/1750s and deletion can be done the same way.



## Stay-Go List and Inventory Report

  Stay-Go List:
    This will create a basic excel stay go list for all items on the property book any item that is assigned to
    a team member or general box will be marked as "GO".


  Inventory Report:
    This mimics the format of the stay-go list but will show if the item is "On Hand" with Yes/No 
    on the main page if No is selected you will be prompted to leave a comment as to why the equipment 
    is missing. Once this is complete the Inventory Report will show all missing items and the comment
    left by the user.
